## About the Project
The project aims to create an AI-powered platform that simplifies the process of filling out various forms, such as those required for exams, job applications, scholarships, and more. By leveraging AI capabilities, the application will automate the form-filling process, generate personalized cover letters, and provide suggestions to enhance the user's chances of success.
